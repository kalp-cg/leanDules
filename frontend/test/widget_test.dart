// This is a basic Flutter widget test.

// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    await tester.pumpWidget(const ProviderScope(child: LearnDuelsApp()));

    // Verify that our app starts with the login screen (or splash).
    // Since we don't have a counter anymore, we check for something else.
